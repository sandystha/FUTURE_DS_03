# College Event Feedback Analysis  
**Data Science & Analytics Internship Project – Future Interns**

##  Project Overview
College events such as technical fests, workshops, seminars, and cultural programs generate valuable student feedback. However, this feedback is often underutilized.

This project analyzes **50,000 student feedback responses** using **data analytics and NLP techniques** to extract actionable insights that can help improve future campus events.

The analysis combines **rating-based evaluation** and **text-based sentiment analysis** to understand student satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze student ratings (1–5 scale) across different event types and departments
- Perform sentiment analysis on textual feedback using NLP
- Visualize satisfaction trends and patterns
- Identify top-performing and low-performing events
- Provide data-driven recommendations for event organizers

---

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**
- **Python**
- **pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation
- **matplotlib / seaborn** – Data visualization
- **TextBlob** – Sentiment analysis (NLP)

---

## Dataset Information
- **Total Records:** 50,000
- **Source:** Simulated Google Form responses
- **Format:** CSV

### Dataset Columns
| Column Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Event_Name | Name of the college event |
| Event_Type | Technical, Workshop, Seminar, Cultural |
| Department | Hosting department |
| Rating | Student rating (1–5) |
| Feedback_Comment | Text feedback from students |

---

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Average rating analysis by:
  - Event Type
  - Department
  - Event Name
- Sentiment analysis on feedback comments
- Visualization of:
  - Rating distributions
  - Sentiment proportions
  - Event and department performance
- Correlation between sentiment and ratings

---

## Key Insights
- Technical events received the highest average ratings, followed closely by workshops and seminars.
- Cultural events showed slightly lower satisfaction, indicating execution-related challenges.
- IT and ECE departments consistently hosted higher-rated events.
- Approximately **60% of feedback is positive**, while **24% is negative**, highlighting scope for improvement.
- Career-oriented events such as **Startup Meetups** and **Cyber Security Talks** achieved the highest satisfaction scores.

---

##  Recommendations
- Improve planning and execution quality, especially for cultural and large-scale events.
- Replicate best practices from high-performing departments like IT and ECE.
- Redesign intensive formats such as hackathons and AI workshops with better structure and guidance.
- Focus more on industry-aligned and career-oriented events.
- Use sentiment analytics regularly to make data-driven improvements.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Upload the dataset (`student_event_feedback_50k.csv`)
3. Run the notebook cells step by step
4. Review visualizations, insights, and recommendations
